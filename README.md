# xaeroID

## Overview

**xaeroID** is a cloudless, privacy-preserving identity system for peer-to-peer applications. Built on post-quantum Falcon-512 cryptography and zero-knowledge proofs, it enables self-sovereign identity management without servers, clouds, or centralized authorities.

Perfect for integration with distributed systems like **xaeroflux**, xaeroID provides cryptographic primitives for group membership, role-based access control, and credential verification‚Äîall while preserving user privacy through cutting-edge ZK-SNARK technology.

## What xaeroID Provides

### üîê **Post-Quantum Identity**
- **Pod-safe XaeroID**: Fixed-size struct (897B public + 1281B secret key)
- **Falcon-512 signatures**: Quantum-resistant cryptographic foundation
- **DID:peer support**: Offline-resolvable decentralized identifiers

### üé≠ **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**
- **RoleCircuit**: Prove sufficient permissions without revealing exact role
- **MembershipCircuit**: Prove group membership without revealing identity
- **PreimageCircuit**: Prove knowledge of secrets without disclosure
- **Arkworks integration**: Groth16 SNARKs on BN254 curve

### üåê **P2P Integration Ready**
- **xaeroflux compatibility**: Built for distributed event systems
- **FFI-ready**: Export to Dart, iOS, Android, WASM
- **Memory-safe**: Zero-copy serialization with bytemuck
